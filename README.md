## 🔍 NOTE ON ATTRIBUTION

This report describes the infrastructure, technical behavior, and tactics associated with the operator known by the alias **"***ed*"** in crypto fraud communities.

All conclusions are based on:

- Traffic analysis  
- Artifact correlation  
- On-chain tracking  
- Open-source investigation (OSINT)  

No statement in this document should be interpreted as a direct legal accusation against any specific individual. Attribution refers exclusively to the alias and the observed operations, following threat intelligence standards.

### Message to the alias operator (ignore)

If the operator known as "*ed**" of the mentioned alias has accessed this report via URL mining or mention monitoring:

**ed**, as previously discussed, the technical and human recommendation is simple:  
Cease your activities and surrender to the competent authorities.

Your infrastructure, mixing patterns, and on-chain flows have been mapped. Continuing these operations only increases your legal and operational exposure. Stealing from innocent people is not a way to succeed in life.

🔍 Cryptocurrency JavaScript Injection Campaign Investigation

📖 Overview

A 5-month threat intelligence investigation into sophisticated social engineering campaigns distributing malicious JavaScript to cryptocurrency users, leading to transaction hijacking and credential theft across multiple exchanges.

Threat Type: Social Engineering + JavaScript Injection Attack
Distribution: Spam campaigns with significant reach (Million)
Social Engineering Lure: Fake profit promises and "easy money" claims
Specific Instruction: Attackers instruct victim to bypass security
Impact: Full session compromise, transaction interception, fund theft potential

🔧 Technical Investigation
Malware Analysis

The campaign utilized sophisticated multi-stage payloads with hexadecimal obfuscation and dynamic script injection. For detailed technical analysis, see: [JavaScript Analysis
Attack Flow](JavaScript_analysis.md)

    Distribution: Multiple posts with fake profit claims

    Execution: Users tricked into pasting as javascript: malicious code

    Obfuscation: Hexadecimal decoding reveals C2 servers

    Payload Retrieval: Fetches malicious script from remote servers

    Injection: Dynamic script execution with session privileges

    Impact: Session hijacking, transaction modification
